## Education
I am currently pursuing a Masters Degree in Financial Analysis student at London Business School. I recently graduated from the University of Southern California in the U.S. <br/>
By the time I graduate from LBS in 2021, I will have accumulated eight years of experience in studying abroad, which added a unique blend of western and oriental culture to my background.

## Career
During my undergraduate study, I have become passionate about the finance industry, and I hope to start my career path in investment banking. After spending a few years acquiring skills and knowledge, I want to work in "buy-side" businesses such as private equity. My ultimate goal is to establish my own fund some time in the future, so that I could effectively manage my money as well as others'.
