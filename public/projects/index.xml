      <description>Gapminder allows us to gain insight about several social-economic factors such as life expectancy and GDP per capita for all countries around the globe. It is also meaningful to find out if there are correlations between these factors to understand the overall trend and make better decisions in the future.

      <description>We have a series of movies data including their name, director, genre, and IMDB ratings. And we are interested in finding whether the ratings for movies of two directors have the same average? In other words, are they equally appealing to audiences in terms of ratings? Let’s take Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton for example and compare the average ratings of their movies using hypothesis testing.
95% Confidence Intervals First, we want to build the 95% confidence intervals for the mean IMDB ratings of Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton to see if there is any overlap.</description>

      <description>IBM data scientists created this fictitional data set to document many job-related characteristics such as employees’ ages, job satisfaction and outcomes like job salaries and attrition. Are there potential relationships between these variables? Let’s explore.
Distribution of Some Statistics First, let’s visualize the data by looking at some histograms.
Employee ages # Employee ages ggplot(hr_cleaned,aes(x=age))+ geom_histogram()+ labs(title = &amp;quot;Distribution of Employee Ages&amp;quot;, subtitle = &amp;quot;Most number of employees are between age 30 and 35&amp;quot;, x = &amp;quot;Age&amp;quot;, y = &amp;quot;Number of People&amp;quot;)+ theme_igray()+ theme(title = element_text(size =12,face = &amp;quot;bold&amp;quot;), axis.</description>
