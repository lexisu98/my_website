<p>IBM data scientists created this fictitional data set to document many job-related characteristics such as employees’ ages, job satisfaction and outcomes like job salaries and attrition. Are there potential relationships between these variables?<br/>
Let’s explore.</p>
<div id="distribution-of-some-statistics" class="section level2">
<h2>Distribution of Some Statistics</h2>
<p>First, let’s visualize the data by looking at some histograms.</p>
<div id="employee-ages" class="section level3">
<h3>Employee ages</h3>
<pre class="r"><code># Employee ages

<h2>Relationship between variables</h2>
<div id="income-by-gender" class="section level3">
<h3>Income by gender</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x=reorder(gender,-monthly_income),y=monthly_income))+

  theme_igray()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/projects/HR_analysis_files/figure-html/income_gender-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Are we progressing toward equal pay between the two genders? Perhaps. The graph shows that men and women have almost the same income distribution in the form of a boxplot.But men seem to have more outliers that are greater than 1.5*IQR.</p>
</div>
<div id="monthly-income-by-job-role" class="section level3">
<h3>Monthly income by job role</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x=reorder(job_role,-monthly_income),y=monthly_income))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title = &quot;Boxplot of Monthly Income for Each Job Role&quot;, 
       subtitle = &quot;Managers earn the highest income, while sales representatives earn the lowest &quot;,
       x = &quot;Job Roles&quot;, y=&quot;Monthly Income&quot;)+
  theme_igray()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, size = 5))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/projects/HR_analysis_files/figure-html/boxplot-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Monthly income can greatly vary from one job role to another. Looking at the boxplot below, managers and research directors earn the highest income, while lab technicians and sales representatives tend to be on the low end. However, for job roles that are located on the lower end, there are several outliers who earn much more than the median income level.</p>
</div>
<div id="income-faceted-by-education-level" class="section level3">
<h3>Income faceted by education level</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x=monthly_income))+
  geom_histogram()+
  facet_wrap(~education)+
  theme_igray()+
  labs(title = &quot;Distribution of Income by Education Level&quot;, 
       subtitle = &quot;All education levels follow a right-skewed distribution&quot;,
       x= &quot;Monthly Income&quot;, y = &quot;Number of People&quot;)+

<p><img src="/projects/HR_analysis_files/figure-html/income_educationlevel-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We can see that doctors have the least number of people. Almost all education levels follow a right-skewed distribution, meaning that regardless of their education level, the majority of them still earn less income below 100,000.</p>
</div>
<div id="income-vs.-age-faceted-by-job-role" class="section level3">
<h3>Income vs. Age, faceted by Job role</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x=age, y=monthly_income))+
  geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;)+

<p><img src="/projects/HR_analysis_files/figure-html/income_age-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Managers and research directors tend to be older, as they exhibit left-skewed distributions.</p>
