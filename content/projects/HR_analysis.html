<blockquote>
<p>IBM data scientists created this fictitional data set to document many job-related characteristics such as employees’ ages, job satisfaction and outcomes like job salaries and attrition. Are there potential relationships between these variables?<br/>
Let’s explore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, let’s visualize the data by looking at some histograms.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(hr_cleaned,aes(x=age))+
  geom_histogram()+
  labs(title = &quot;Distribution of Employee Ages&quot;, 
       subtitle = &quot;Most number of employees are between age 30 and 35&quot;, 
       x = &quot;Age&quot;, y = &quot;Number of People&quot;)+
  theme_igray()+
  theme(title = element_text(size =12,face = &quot;bold&quot;),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 10), 
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10, angle = 90))</code></pre>

<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(hr_cleaned,aes(x=years_at_company))+
  geom_histogram()+
  labs(title = &quot;Distribution of Years Worked at Company&quot;,
       subtitle = &quot;A right-skewed distribution shows most employees have worked for very few years&quot;, 
       x = &quot;Years at Company&quot;, y=&quot;Number of People&quot;)+
  theme_igray()+
  theme(title = element_text(size =12,face = &quot;bold&quot;),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10, angle = 90))</code></pre>

<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(hr_cleaned,aes(x=monthly_income))+

       x=&quot;Years since Last Promotion&quot;, 
       y=&quot;Number of People&quot;)+
  theme_igray()+

<p>Are we progressing toward equal pay between the two genders? Perhaps. The graph shows that men and women have almost the same income distribution in the form of a boxplot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x=reorder(gender,-monthly_income),y=monthly_income))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title = &quot;Boxplot of Monthly Income for Men and Women&quot;, 
       subtitle = &quot;Both genders have almost equal income distribution&quot;,
       x = &quot;Gender&quot;, y=&quot;Monthly Income&quot;)+
  theme_igray()</code></pre>

<p>Monthly income can greatly vary from one job role to another. Looking at the boxplot below, managers and research directors earn the highest income, while lab technicians and sales representatives tend to be on the low end. However, for job roles that are located on the lower end, there are several outliers who earn much more than the median income level.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x=reorder(job_role,-monthly_income),y=monthly_income))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title = &quot;Boxplot of Monthly Income for Each Job Role&quot;, 
       subtitle = &quot;Managers earn the highest income, while sales representatives earn the lowest &quot;,
       x = &quot;Job Roles&quot;, y=&quot;Monthly Income&quot;)+
  theme_igray()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, size = 5))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/projects/HR_analysis_files/figure-html/boxplot-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We can see that doctors have the least number of people. Almost all education levels follow a right-skewed distribution, meaning that regardless of their education level, the majority of them still earn less income below 100,000.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(hr_cleaned, aes(x=monthly_income))+
  geom_histogram()+
  facet_wrap(~education)+
  theme_igray()+
  labs(title = &quot;Distribution of Income by Education Level&quot;, 
       subtitle = &quot;All education levels follow a right-skewed distribution&quot;,
       x= &quot;Monthly Income&quot;, y = &quot;Number of People&quot;)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, size = 5))</code></pre>
